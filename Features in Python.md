Features in Python
===============

1.Free and Open Source
* Python language is freely available at the official website and you can download it from the given download link below click on the Download Python keyword. Download Python Since it is open-source, this means that source code is also available to the public. 

2.Easy to code
* Python is a high-level programming language. Python is very easy to learn the language as compared to other languages like C, C#, Javascript, Java, etc. It is very easy to code in the Python language and anybody can learn Python basics in a few hours or days. It is also a developer-friendly language. 


3. Easy to Read
* Learning Python is quite simple. As was already established, Python's syntax is really straightforward. The code block is defined by the indentations rather than by semicolons or brackets.


4.Object-Oriented Language
* One of the key features of Python is Object-Oriented programming. Python supports object-oriented language and concepts of classes, object encapsulation, etc. 


5.High -Level Language
* Python is a high-level language. When we write programs in Python, we do not need to remember the system architecture, nor do we need to manage the memory.


6.Python is a Portable Language
* Python language is also a portable language. For example, if we have Python code for Windows and if we want to run this code on other platforms such as Linux, Unix, and Mac then we do not need to change it, we can run this code on any platform.


7.Interpreted Language
* Python is an Interpreted Language because Python code is executed line by line at a time. like other languages C, C++, Java, etc. there is no need to compile Python code this makes it easier to debug our code. The source code of Python is converted into an immediate form called bytecode.


8.Dynamically Typed Language
* Python is a dynamically-typed language. That means the type (for example- int, double, long, etc.) for a variable is decided at run time not in advance because of this feature we don't need to specify the type of variable.


9.Easy to Debug
* Excellent information for mistake tracing. You will be able to quickly identify and correct the majority of your program's issues once you understand how to interpret Python's error traces. Simply by glancing at the code, you can determine what it is designed to perform.


10. GUI Programming Support
* Graphical User interfaces can be made using a module such as PyQt5, PyQt4, wxPython, or Tk in Python. PyQt5 is the most popular option for creating graphical apps with Python.
