Interpreter
.....................
Translates line by line (one statement at a time) into machine code.
Executes immediately after translation.
Slower execution (because translation happens during runtime).
Easy for debugging since it shows errors instantly.
Example languages: Python, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP.
Compiler
................
Translates the entire program into machine code at once and creates an executable file.
Executes faster (because program is already translated before running).
Errors are shown after full compilation, not instantly.
Example languages: C, C++, Java (partly â€“ compiles to bytecode), Go.
